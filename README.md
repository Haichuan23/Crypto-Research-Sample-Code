# ECON-Research-Code-Library

I have worked as a research assistant for Professor Anthony Zhang from UChicago Booth since Feb,2022.
During this period, I have extensive experience working with data cleaning, data preparation,
plotting stylized facts, and running regressions. I have collected the code that I wrote and established
this code library for my future reference.

I have worked on three different projects under the guidance of Professor Anthony Zhang:
1) Stablecoin Project:

We want to empirically analyze the risk and return of stablecoins. What type of stablecoins peg well? How macro
condition influence the behavior of stablecoins?

2) Crypto Exchange Project:

We study what triggers coin listing and the relationship between crypto exchanges.

3) Liquidation Ladder Project:

We study which factors lead to the fluctuation of liquidation prices and change the behavior of Maker Dao Vaults.

Starting from Oct 2022, I have collaborated with Uniswap Labs on arbitrage-related research.

Once the paper/blogpost is published, I will attach the link of our work into this introduction. However, the data will
not be shared with the public in this repo. Also, I have only kept the scaffold of my code.
